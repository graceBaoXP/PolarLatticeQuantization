Dear Editor and Reviewers:

Please follow the below introduction to use this package.

PolarQZ.m : This is the main file to show the lossy compression performance of polar lattices. 
            You can check the realized distortion and the compression speed there.
            We gave three target distortions 0.10 0,14 and 0.20 for exmaples.

LatticeQZ_Para_settings_FixSigma_s.m: The m file is to set the parameter of the polar lattices
                                      for fixed sigma_s and given target distortion
                                      we check the distance between Y and Y' in our paper.
                                      we calculate the flatness factor associated with the partition chain
                                      and obtain the proportions of the set F I and S for each level

CalculateZn.m:          This m file is used to prepare the Bhattacharyya parameters for the polar codes at each level.
                        As we mentioned in our paper, the method is based on Tal and Vardy's method in "How to construct polar codes"
